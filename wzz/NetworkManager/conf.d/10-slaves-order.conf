# This configuration file changes NetworkManager's behavior to order
# slaves by ifindex when they are autoactivated.
#
# See "man NetworkManager.conf" for more information about these
# and other keys.
#
# Do not edit this file; it will be overwritten on upgrades. If you
# want to override the values here, or set additional values, you can
# do so by adding another file (eg, "99-local.conf") in
# /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/ and setting keys there.
