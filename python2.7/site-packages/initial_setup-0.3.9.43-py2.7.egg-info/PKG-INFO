Description: Initial Setup
        =============
        Initial Setup is an application that can run during the first start
        of a newly installed computer and makes it possible to configure the
        computer according to the needs of the user.
        
        As most of the configuration options are already present during the
        OS installation in Anaconda, Initial Setup mainly hosts options that
        need to be presented during the first start, such as displaying the
        EULA on RHEL. Initial Setup is also often used to create a user account,
        as many systems are often automatically installed with kickstart
        and the user is only expected to create their own user account once
        the newly installed machine is started for the first time.
        
        Still, while Initial Setup normally does not have many options
        available, if the firstboot --recofing kickstart command is provided
        in the installation kickstart, Initial Setup will show all configuration
        options available. This is usually used for OEM OS installations,
        where an OEM installs the computer, which is then shipped to the end user
        which uses Initial Setup for the final configuration of the operating system.
        
        Architecture
        ============
        Initial Setup is basically just a thin wrapper for running spokes from Anaconda.
        Still, it has its own Hub, one spoke (the EULA spoke) and a translation domain ("initial-setup").
        
        As with Anaconda, Initial Setup has both a GUI and TUI version and the package is split
        to a core and GUI & TUI sub packages.
        
        As Initial Setup needs to run during the early boot, it is started by a systemd unit
        configured to start before the normal login screen. On RHEL7 Initial Setup is by default
        followed by the legacy Firstboot utility, which hosts the Subscription Manager plugin.
        If the given OS instance uses the Gnome 3 desktop environment, Firstboot is followed by
        the Gnome Initial Setup, which enables the user to customize their computer even more.
        On Fedora Initial Setup is followed directly by GIS, provided Gnome 3 is installed.
        
        * RHEL7: IS -> Firstboot -> [GIS]
        * Fedora: IS -> [GIS]
        
        Addons
        ======
        Like Anaconda, also Initial Setup can be used to host third party addons - flexible
        yet powerful modules that can configure the system based on data in kickstart
        while presenting a nice UI to the user. Addons can have a GUI, TUI or can be
        headless, working only with data in their kickstart section or from other sources.
