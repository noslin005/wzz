Description: Dependency injection framework for Python
        
        DI_ENABLE - module variable to enable/disable
                    the whole DI mechanism (default: True)
        
        @inject   - decorator for classes, function or methods
                    that prepares the injections and executes
                    then when the decorated function or method
                    is called.
        
                    When used on a class it only prepares the
                    structures and instance methods that use DI
                    must be decorated by @usesclassinject
        
        @usesclassinject - this marks an instance method which
                           should use DI prepared by @inject
                           on a class level
        
        Known issues and limitations:
        
        - it is not able to redefine a variable name which is
          also provided by closure (closure one has priority)
        
        - decorated class shares it's DI dictionary between
          all it's instances
